## Data Preparation
The project begins with reading and preparing forex data from a CSV file. The data is cleaned and transformed to be ready for analysis and prediction.

## Data Visualization
The repository includes functions for visualizing exchange rates over time, including plotting the USD to EGP exchange rate and the Egyptian currency rate. Additionally, it visualizes correlations between different exchange rates using heatmap.

## Exchange Rate Prediction
Several machine learning models are applied to predict exchange rates. The models used include DecisionTreeRegressor, LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, Support Vector, and Logistic Regression. The data is split into training and testing sets, and the models are evaluated for their prediction accuracy.

## Model Evaluation
The project assesses the performance of the machine learning models by calculating mean squared errors and visualizing the predicted rates alongside the actual rates.

Feel free to explore the code and use it for your own forex analysis and prediction projects.

>[Note]
> Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, and the 'forex.csv' data file in the same directory before running the code.

For detailed instructions on how to use the code, please refer to the code comments and documentation within the Jupyter notebook or Python script.

Happy forex analysis and prediction!
